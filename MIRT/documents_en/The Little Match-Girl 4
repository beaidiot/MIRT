¡°Grandmother!¡± exclaimed the child, ¡°oh, take me with you! I know thou1 wilt2leave me as soon as the match goes out£¬ thou wilt vanish like warm fire in the stove, like the splendid New Year's feast, like the beautiful large Christmas tree!¡± and she hastily lighted all the remaining matches in the bundle, last her grandmother should disappear. And the matches burned with such a blaze of splendor, that noon day could scarcely have been brighter. Never had the good old grandmother looked so tall and stately, so beautiful and kind£» she took the little girl in her arms, and they both flew together-higher, till they were in that place where neither cold, nor hunger, nor pain, is ever known£¬ they were in paradise.But in the cold morning hour, crouching in the corner of the wall, the poor little girl was found£ºher cheeks glowing, her lips smiling£¬ frozen to death on the last night of the old Year. The New Year's sun shone on the lifeless child£» motionless she sat there with the matches in her lap, one bundle of them quite burnt out.¡°She has been trying to warm herself, poor thing!¡± the people said£¬ but no one knew of the sweet visions she had beheld, or how gloriously she and her grandmother were celebrating their New Year's festival.
